# Onism
High-performance CLDR library for .NET. It allows you to build an efficient binary representation of CLDR data and to consume this representation easily.

## Usage
How to get the name of the first month in the Hebrew calendar in British English? Couldn't be easier!

```csharp
var data = CldrData.LoadFromFile("cldr.bin");
var path = "dates.calendars.hebrew.months.format.abbreviated.1";

Console.WriteLine(data.GetValue(path, enGB)); // Tishri
```
